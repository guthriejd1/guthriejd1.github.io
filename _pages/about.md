I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University advised by [Enrique Mallada](https://mallada.ece.jhu.edu/).
My research is focused on finding creative ways to pose and solve problems arising in planning and control using numerical optimization. I am also interested in how these techniques can be best merged with deep learning approaches.

In addition to my PhD studies, I also work at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu/). My current work is focused on advanced trajectory optimization and guidance methods for future aerospace vehicles. I previously worked on stability and control of pulsed power systems along with a little work in formal verification methods. Prior to JHUAPL, I worked at [General Dynamics Electric Boat](www.gdeb.com) doing power system modeling and control design for a next-generation submarine which uses electric propulsion.
